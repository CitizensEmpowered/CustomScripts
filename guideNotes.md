Remember to:

 + Should guide the next developer through copy-pasting a form for sign up and such
     * Also small guide for converting Insightly's "Web to Contact" form to Squarespace's format using the insightlyToSquarespace.js converter script
 + jQuery/Firebase on every page?
     * Yes.
 + Log Out doesn't have to be a form
     * Just a button with an id
 + Log of who's logged in?
     * ? Forgot the benefit/desire for this
 + Make a note of the Heroku proxy server setup for Insightly (hiding credentials)
